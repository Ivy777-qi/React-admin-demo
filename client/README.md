# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<Modal /> 默认关闭后状态不会自动清空, 如果希望每次打开都是新内容，请设置 destroyOnClose。

<Modal /> 和 Form 一起配合使用时，设置 destroyOnClose 也不会在 Modal 关闭时销毁表单字段数据，
需要设置 <Form preserve={false} />。

1. 子组件调用父组件的方法: 将父组件的方法以函数属性的形式传递给子组件, 子组件就可以调用
2. 父组件调用子组件的方法: 在父组件中通过 ref 得到子组件标签对象(也就是组件对象), 调用其方法
   \*/

/\*
使用 ref

1. 创建 ref 容器: thi.pw = React.createRef()
2. 将 ref 容器交给需要获取的标签元素: <PictureWall ref={this.pw} />
3. 通过 ref 容器读取标签元素: this.pw.current
   \*/

this.props.history.push('/detail', { product }) 可以传对象过去
